# Express.js-Note-Taker
Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes. This application will use an Express.js back end and will save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## Disclaimer 

The applications does not work. 
So far it can to read and save objects to the `db.json` file, as well as read files under the `static public file` but I could not figure out how to use an npm library to generate new Ids for each new object, which are required to be able to identify each object, and to render them into the HTML.
As always, Im commited to come back and continue with my work.
